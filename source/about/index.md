Just a few things about me, in case you were wondering.

On the internet:
* I typically go by the moniker "Taxes" on places like Steam and Battle.net and other online services. It doesn't have any special meaning, it was just a name I chose out of the blue for a _Dungeons & Dragons_ character that I really enjoyed playing. It is amusing that sometimes I get followed by random people on Twitter looking for actual tax information. 
* I use this blog to post about random things, but usually focused on games and programming.
* I have a Twitter account that I sometimes post things to: [@Taxes_dev](https://twitter.com/Taxes_dev)
* I also have code at my Gitea site: [git.taxes.dev/taxes](https://git.taxes.dev/taxes)
* I'm generally friendly. If you want to chat over Twitter, feel free.

In real life:
* I am a software engineer and technical product manager (mostly large scalable services and game services) for two decades. If you care about the professional stuff: [havisullivan.com](https://havisullivan.com/)
* I love to code. Lately it's been a lot of C++ and Rust, but I also know JavaScript, C#, Java, and a smattering of other more obscure languages.
* I'm a woman married to another woman and a native Texan.
* I have a couple of dogs. They're cute.
* I like anime and _My Little Pony_.
* Sometimes I bake cookies.
* Full disclosure: I work for Blizzard Entertainment. But this blog is obviously my personal space, and my opinions are not my employer's. I generally try my best to call it out when I'm promoting something that benefits me financially.
