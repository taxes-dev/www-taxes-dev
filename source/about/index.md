Just a few things about me, in case you were wondering.

On the internet:
* I go by the moniker "Taxes" on places like Steam and Battle.net and other online services. It doesn't have any special meaning, it was just a name I chose out of the blue for a _Dungeons & Dragons_ character that I really enjoyed playing. It is amusing that sometimes I get followed by random people on social media looking for actual tax information. 
* I use this blog to post about random things, but usually focused on games and programming.
* I have a Mastodon account that I sometimes post things to: [@taxes@mastodon.gamedev.place](https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@taxes)
* I also have code at my GitHub site: [github.com/taxes-dev](https://github.com/taxes-dev)
* I'm generally friendly. If you want to chat on social media, feel free.

In real life:
* I am a software engineer (mostly large scalable services and game services). If you care about the professional stuff: [blitterfly.com](https://blitterfly.com/)
* I love to code. Lately it's been a lot of C++ and Rust, but I also know JavaScript, C#, Java, and a smattering of other more obscure languages.
* I'm a woman married to another woman and a native Texan, though I currently live in Wisconsin.
* I like anime, _My Little Pony_, and LEGOs.
* Sometimes I bake cookies.
* Full disclosure: This blog is obviously my personal space, and my opinions are not my employer's. I generally try my best to call it out when I'm promoting something that benefits me financially.
