This was a tough choice, but I'm going to go with _Final Fantasy X_. I didn't even play it, but I remember being riveted while a friend played on the PS2 years ago. I just wanted him to skip all the dumb combat sections and get back to the awesome cut scenes. Maybe it was just the novelty of it at the time, since that was the first fully voiced game I'd seen, but I do remember thinking that it was a whole new level of storytelling in games.
