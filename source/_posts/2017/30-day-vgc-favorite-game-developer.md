Well, it should be obvious, but my favorite game developer is Blizzard Entertainment, and I'm not just saying that because I work for the studio. I have a long love affair with Blizzard games going back to when I was first introduced to _Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness_ and _Diablo_ at a LAN party back in 1997. It was my dream for a long time to work for one of the best studios on the planet, and I'm excited to be part of the Blizzard family.

_Diablo_ is still my favorite franchise of all time.

Of course, it feels a bit self-serving to put my employer at the top of the list, so if I have to pick a second choice, it would be Nintendo. The first console I owned was the Nintendo Entertainment System, and I have fond memories of all the great games from the 8-bit era. Nintendo has always made my primary console of choice (even the Wii U), and I love all the first party titles. Some of the recent Nintendo games I really enjoyed were _Super Mario Maker_, _Yoshi's Wooly World_, and _Mario Kart 8_.
