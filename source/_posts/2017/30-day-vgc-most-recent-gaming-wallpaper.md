So I'll admit I kind of fail on today's challenge. I actually can't remember the last time I had a gaming-themed wallpaper on my desktop. On my laptop that I'm currently writing this post on, I've had this Avatar Won (from _Legend of Korra_) image as my desktop for the last couple years. I actually don't see or change my wallpaper very often because I rarely have so few windows open that I can actually _see_ my desktop.

Trying to remember the last gaming wallpaper I used... I think it was something related to _Pokemon Omega Ruby & Alpha Sapphire_ back when those games came out, but I can't really recall.
