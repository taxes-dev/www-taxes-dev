For the award for most annoying character, I'm going to hand it to Anders from _Dragon Age II_. (Yes, he was in _Dragon Age: Origins - Awakening_ too, but he specifically annoyed me in the second game.) I tried really hard to give all the different team members in DA2 a chance. Even Fenris who's a bit of a tough nut to crack turns out to have an interesting story if you poke at him enough. Anders, on the other hand just made me want to punch him in the mouth every time he talked. His level of whininess is only rivaled by Anakin in _Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones_.

I think the writers tried to make Anders a sympathetic and tragic character, but honestly his motivations are so selfish and his lack of remorse so appaling that he's really just not likeable. Once you put that with his constant whinging, he's just not fun to have in your party. On one of my playthroughs I tried really hard to befriend him and see if moving through his personal story arc would make him more likeable, but nope it doesn't help at all.

I guess if there's anything positive I can say about him, it's that the same qualities that make him unlikeable that also make him one of the most believable and human characters in the game.
