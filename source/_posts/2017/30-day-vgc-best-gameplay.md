It should come as no surprise that for the best gameplay award I'm going back to {% post_link 30-day-vgc-my-guilty-pleasure-game "my self-proclaimed guilty pleasure, Destiny" %}. Despite its shallow story and grindy, repetitive missions and loot ladder, I still come back to this game time and time again simply because the moment-to-moment gameplay is just _so damn good_. The simple mechanics of blasting baddies and other Guardians is unmatched in excellence by other FPS titles (IMHO).
