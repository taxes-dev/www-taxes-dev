When I first got my Super NES, I instantly fell in love with _The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past_. To this day, it's one of my top all-time favorite games. So much so that when I recently got a {% post_link time-to-start-the-new-year-with-a-challenge "modded Game Boy Advance" %}, the first cartridge I purchased for it was [_The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past & Four Swords_](https://zeldawiki.org/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_A_Link_to_the_Past_%26_Four_Swords).
