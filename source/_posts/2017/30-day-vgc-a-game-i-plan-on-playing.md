I have two upcoming games that I'm really looking forward to. First is _Horizon: Zero Dawn_. I was immediately drawn to its visuals and the unique setting. Plus, I'm a sucker for cool open world games.

Speaking of open world games, the other game I'm excited about is _The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild_. I can't wait to get my hands on the Nintendo Switch and this game!
