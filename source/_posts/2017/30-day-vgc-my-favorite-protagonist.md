It's hard to pick just one favorite protagonist, but since I have to, I'm going with _Mass Effect's_ Commander Shepard. Naturally I played the games as FemShep, and I love that Shepard's character is just a no-nonsene kind of leader who gets stuff done. The sad part is that I imagine a lot of the character's great development was based in practicality since the same dialogue and storylines had to be shared with the male version of the character, but I'll take what I can get. It was nice having a strong female lead in a game that didn't have a bunch of tropey emotional/historical baggage or scenes that compromised her as a character.
