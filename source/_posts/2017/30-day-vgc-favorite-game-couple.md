Unfortunately games don't give us a lot of great couples to choose from. I tried reading some "best video game couples" articles to try and jog my memory, but it was all the same selections, and some of them weren't even canon, just implied in some cases (like Link & Zelda). So for today's challenge I'm going to respond with:

**The best video game couples are the ones you choose yourself.**

In particular, I'm going to call out the _Dragon Age_ and _Mass Effect_ series by BioWare as my favorite games for romance.

Yeah, I was one of those dingbats who fell for Garrus. What a great guy.
