I have a tie for today's challenge. First, if I had to choose a best soundtrack overall, I would go with _Persona 4 Golden_. The tunes in this game are just super catchy and really get you pumped while playing.

It's important to note that this one is split into two albums if you want the full experience. You need the [_Persona 4_ OST](https://www.amazon.com/Persona-Original-Soundtrack-PERSONA-O-S-T/dp/B001AO15WW/) which has the songs from the original game as well as the [_Persona 4 Golden_ OST](https://www.amazon.com/Persona4-Golden-PERSONA-GOLDEN-S-T/dp/B007WVZ38O) which has the additional songs from the re-release. Sadly they're only available as import CDs so they're a little pricey.

In addition to this soundtrack, however, I feel like I would be remiss if I didn't mention the [soundtrack from _Shantae and the Pirate's Curse_](https://virt.bandcamp.com/album/shantae-and-the-pirates-curse-ost). This is one of those soundtracks that's just made of pure fun and tends to get in your head and not leave.
