I had to think about this one, but I settled on a particular stretch of scenes from _Dragon Age: Inquisition_ (warning: spoilerz follow). The close of the first act of the game sees you and your companions routed from your home base of Haven and driven into the mountains. This whole scene, when you first get to meet the BBEG to the reveal of Skyhold, really showcases the epic scale of the conflict and the world you're playing in. Also, the song at the camp just before Skyhold gives me goosebumps every time.
