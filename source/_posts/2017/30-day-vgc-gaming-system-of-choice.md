Nintendo was my first love, since the original Nintendo Entertainment System I owned back in the late 80s. I've owned every Nintendo console and handheld with the exception of the GameCube (and the ill-fated VirtualBoy, but who counts that one). I even liked the Wii U. I would have loved more third party titles, but the first party titles were plentiful enough that I still feel I got my money's worth. If I had to pick a specific Nintendo system, I'd say I have the most fondness for (and playtime on) my 3DS.

Incidentally, tonight is the new [stream for the Nintendo Switch](http://www.polygon.com/2017/1/11/14239454/nintendo-switch-event-livestream-announcement). So hyped!
