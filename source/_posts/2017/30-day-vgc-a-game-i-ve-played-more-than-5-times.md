There are very few games that I've just enjoyed so thoroughly as to play them all the way through multiple times. _Dragon Age: Origins_ is one such game, however. I really enjoyed that there were multiple origin stories to play through for each race, and I had to try them all. I also wanted to try out different combinations of parties and romance options. It's one game that I definitely got more than my money's worth in terms of hours entertained.
