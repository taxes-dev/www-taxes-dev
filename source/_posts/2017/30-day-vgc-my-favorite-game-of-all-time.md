Personally I'm not a huge fan of picking a "favorite game of all time." My tastes change over the years, and depending on my mood on any given day one game may be better than another. But, I suppose if I'm going to finish this challenge properly, I have to choose something. So in order to qualify as my favorite of all time, the game in question has to meet the following requirements:

* It's something I've played multiple times.
* It's not something that came out recently. (I can hardly judge something as being anything of "all time" if it's only been around for a year or two.)
* In this day and of age of choice overload, it has to be a game that I go back to when I can't decide what I want to play.

I figure that's some reasonable criteria. So what game meets all of them?

For me, it's _Terraria_. At 335 hours played as of this posting, it's not my biggest timesink. (That honor would go either to my 900 hours in _Pokémon X & Y_ or who knows how many hours in various MMOs over the years.) But it is a game that both my wife and I like to go back to ever now and then just for some good, relaxing fun. Especially if we can't decide on any of our new games to play. The procedurally generated worlds create plenty of replayability, and I love the discovery of just digging deep and looking for treasures while my wife is mostly into the building aspects.
