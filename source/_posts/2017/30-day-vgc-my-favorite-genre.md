I've been gaming for a number of years now, and over the course of time my tastes have changed. Ever since I first experienced _Final Fantasy_ on the NES, my favorite genre was RPGs. I loved the 8- and 16-bit JRPGs, and when I started gaming more on PCs I found a long list of great RPGs, especially from EA/BioWare. _Neverwinter Nights_, _Knights of the Old Republic_, _Dragon Age_, and _Mass Effect_ are all full of great gaming memories for me.

Interestingly, as I've gotten older I've actually started to appreciate more action-oriented titles. I'm not as into the slow-paced, turn-based mechanics of earlier RPGs and would rather play a good action-RPG. I think games like _Borderlands_ and _Destiny_ really turned me on to the idea of pasting RPG-like mechanics on to other genres, and I really enjoy the hybrid approaches now.
