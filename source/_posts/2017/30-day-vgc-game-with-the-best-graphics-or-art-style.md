I can easily give the award in this category to _Yoshi's Wooly World_. Screenshots actually don't do this game justice. It's such a treat to see this game in motion while playing it. Everything is cute and the fluffy yarn world just feels great to play in. It certainly doesn't hurt that this is also a solid platformer as well. Bring a friend, too, as the co-op play and figuring out puzzles together is a lot of fun.
