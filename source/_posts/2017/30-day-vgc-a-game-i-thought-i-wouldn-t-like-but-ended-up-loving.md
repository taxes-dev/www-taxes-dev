Back in my post on {% post_link 30-day-vgc-my-favorite-genre "my favorite genre" %}, I noted that I really enjoyed the _Borderlands_ series because of its hybridization of RPG and FPS mechanics. To add a little background to that, FPS used to be my _least_ favorite genre. I just didn't find them that compelling. So I actually found little interest in _Borderlands_ since I saw it as an FPS first. But then some friends roped me into playing _Borderlands 2_ co-op, and well, the rest is history...
