I don't really have a specific game that I think _everyone_ should play. Everyone's tastes are different, so I don't think there'll ever be any one game that every gamer will enjoy. Instead, I'll offer you a broad suggestion. Play an older game (or "retro" if you prefer). I'm not suggesting that older games are somehow superior to modern ones, but they did influence a lot of things to come after them. Do you like RPGs? Try out something like _Wizardry_ or _Ultima_. Prefer action games? Pick up a copy of _Mega Man_ or _DOOM_. Just try something a little older and take a look at gaming's roots. You'll find that they're really not nearly as different from modern games as you might think. You may not even be able to finish them, but that's okay. Just take some time and _experience_ them.
