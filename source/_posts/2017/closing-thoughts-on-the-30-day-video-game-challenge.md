I finally wrapped up the {% post_link time-to-start-the-new-year-with-a-challenge "challenge I started" %} at the beginning of the year. So first off, hurray for no more spam! I'm actually bit relieved that I finished it, but also proud of myself for managed to stick to the one-post-a-day schedule. It actually forced me to write on a daily basis, which I don't always want to do.

You may have also noticed a lack of updates on [Critterbits](/tags/critterbits/) this month. I haven't abandoned the project, but I also haven't made a lot of progress. My wife and I have both lamented our lack of progress on personal projects this month. It turns out all of the political background noise going on in the U.S. makes it hard to motivate ourselves to be creative. Instead I've spent a lot of my free time just staring at YouTube videos and occasionally playing some video games. But every time I opened my code projects, I just couldn't figure out what I wanted to do with it.

The exercise of writing did inspire me to work some more on a _Dungeons & Dragons_ campaign idea I've been toying with. I got the basic setting as well as some custom races worked out. I'd like at some point to write a full OGL-based 5E-compatible ruleset, but for now just to try it out I'm using the stock classes. I'm also working on the first few modules to make sure I have plenty of content ready before I recruit players.

Well, let's hope February is a bit more productive for me. We'll see how that turns out. Especially with _Horizon: Zero Dawn_, _The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild_, and _Persona 5_ all releasing in the next few months, I need to get some more traction on both Critterbits and my D&D campaign before the end of the month!
