Recently I picked up _Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2_, so that's what I've been playing lately. I'll admit this is not one of the better games I've played, but there's something addictive about this series that I can't really put my finger on. Like _Destiny_, despite the games flaws, I really like the core gameplay and just love turning my brain off for a while and smashing some face. I only wish they could figure out how to make multiplayer functionality less onerous. The awkward UI for setting up a team and trying to play with friends is way more difficult than it should be.

Due to the frenetic nature of the gameplay, it's a little hard to capture a screenshot of actual fighting. So here's a shot of my Saiyan girl, Sarada, after winning a match.
