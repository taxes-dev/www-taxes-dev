I almost gave this one to Handsome Jack from the _Borderlands_ series, but then I realized that I couldn't overlook the evil clown that is Kefka from _Final Fantasy VI_. This guy just exuded pure, over-the-top evil without remorse. You can't really beat a guy who aspires to become a god and actually succeeds. [Also, his laugh will haunt my dreams for all time.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyZoe-r9qb0)
