Honestly I've had a pretty good time with most sequels that I've played, so this was a tough one for me. While not truly a sequel, I'm going to choose _Pokémon Omega Ruby & Alpha Sapphire_ as a follow-up game that disappointed me. I'm a big fan of the entire series of Pokémon games, and the 6th generation _Pokémon X & Y_ was definitely my favorite before the latest installment, _Sun & Moon_. It was the first game that featured fully 3D environments and Pokémon, and they made a lot of quality of life improvements that made the game a lot more accessible and a lot less grindy than previous entries in the franchise.

_Omega Ruby & Alpha Sapphire_, on the other hand, feels a bit regressive. There are some really cool additions like the [DexNav](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/DexNav), but overall the design lacks the cohesion that was present in _X & Y_. It's easy to get lost when you're trying to remember where to go for the next plot point, and you end up seeing a lot of the same pokémon repeated over and over. I think in some cases they just tried too hard to stay true to the original _Ruby & Sapphire_, and that meant throwing out some of the evolution of the series in the intervening decade.

Whereas I have almost a thousand hours on my _X & Y_ game and over a hundred on my new _Sun & Moon_ cartridge, I barely managed to force myself to get through a single playthrough of _Omega Ruby & Alpha Sapphire_, so I think that definitely qualifies as a relative disappointment.
