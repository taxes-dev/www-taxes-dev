I've played so many really good games over the years, especially RPGs, so it's hard to pick one stand out story that's better than the rest. If I had to choose just one, though, I'm going to go with _Dragon Age: Inquisition_. The main story is pretty cool in its own right and wraps up loose ends from the DLC from _Dragon Age II_, but I especially love getting involved in all the individual stories of your companion characters. In particular, I enjoyed getting to know [Sera](http://dragonage.wikia.com/wiki/Sera), because when you first meet her she seems like a completely random nutcase, but the more you peel back the onion of her story, you realize that she's a very complicated person. [Blackwall's story](http://dragonage.wikia.com/wiki/Blackwall) comes in a very close second.
