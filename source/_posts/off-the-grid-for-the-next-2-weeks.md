Well, not completely off the grid. But next week is my anniversary, and we're heading off to Disney World for the week, so I'll be ignoring the Internet for the most part and definitely not writing any code.

After that, I have to head off to sunny Anaheim for [BlizzCon 2016](https://blizzcon.com/en-us/)! Sadly I won't be enjoying it the same way the fans do; I'll be spending most of my time locked up in a war room learning the ropes on BlizzCon.com operations. Keeping the lights on when so many fans are excitedly hitting the web site is a big task.

Good luck without me. I'll be back before too long.
